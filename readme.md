## Introduction
The **Movie Review Sentiment Detector** is a cutting-edge web application that analyzes movie reviews to classify them as **Positive** or **Negative**. Utilizing a pre-trained Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), this project aims to empower movie enthusiasts with insights that help them make informed viewing decisions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip

### Steps to Set Up
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saadsohail05/movie-review-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd movie-review-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Use the following command to install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy tensorflow streamlit matplotlib
   ```

## Usage
To launch the application, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Visit `https://moviereviewsentimentanalyzer.streamlit.app/` in your web browser to access the application.

### Example
1. Enter your review in the text area.
2. Click **Analyze Sentiment** to receive sentiment classification and a confidence score.

## Features
- **🌟 Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies reviews as Positive or Negative using a sophisticated RNN model.
- **📊 Confidence Score**: Provides a confidence score that reflects the model's certainty in its prediction.
- **💻 User-friendly Interface**: Designed with Streamlit for an interactive experience.
- **📝 Example Reviews**: Predefined reviews for quick analysis without the need for user input.

## Data
The project utilizes the **IMDB movie reviews dataset**, comprising 50,000 labeled reviews for training and evaluation.

### Preprocessing Steps
- Tokenization and mapping of reviews to word indices.
- Padding of reviews to ensure a consistent input size for the model.

## Methodology
The application employs a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**, utilizing the following libraries:
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the RNN model.
- **Keras**: For simplified model creation and training.
- **Streamlit**: To develop the interactive web application interface.

## Results
The model demonstrates effective classification capabilities, accurately predicting sentiments for a significant portion of movie reviews. The confidence score allows users to understand the model's certainty regarding each classification.

## Conclusion
The **Movie Review Sentiment Detector** showcases the practical application of machine learning in sentiment analysis. It provides users with valuable insights into movie reviews, helping them choose films based on sentiment.

## Future Work
- **🔍 Model Enhancement**: Experiment with advanced architectures like LSTM or GRU to improve accuracy.
- **🌍 Broader Dataset**: Integrate a wider range of reviews, including international films.
- **⚡ Real-time Feedback**: Implement mechanisms for real-time user feedback based on their input reviews.
